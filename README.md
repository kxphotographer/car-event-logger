# Car event logger project

This is a project for following 2 purposes:

1. To store and manage car event data: odometer readings, fueling, maintenances, services, etc.
2. To study and share the software development architecture and patterns.

## Detail about 1

I have a SUBARU SAMBAR which has already discontinued as an in-house manufactured car by former Fuji Heavy Industries (nowadays SUBARU corporation) in 2012, and I had been longing for this car since I took my driver's license in 2015, because of its unique characteristics compared to other Kei cars that day, and even now.

To drive this car as long as possible, I want to manage any kind of information about this car. This project is mainly for this purpose.

## Detail about 2

Putting aside the main purpose mentioned above, I also want to study and think about how I can apply architecture and patterns to software development through this project.
